**SOC Analyst** with a focus on **threat detection** and **incident response**.
I investigate security events across cloud and endpoint telemetry, correlating logs to detect credential abuse, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. I work with SIEM and EDR to tune detections, reduce alert fatigue, and improve response workflows.

I support SOC operations through vulnerability management, automation, and threat modeling, aligning detections to frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and NIST. My tooling includes Microsoft Defender, cloud-native logs, Tenable, Qualys, Python, and Bash.
